# LAB | Comparing Regular Neural Networks vs CNNs on MNIST 


## Introduction

In this activity, you will build and compare two neural network models for classifying the MNIST dataset:
1. A regular sequential neural network
2. A basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

We'll use TensorFlow to implement both models and compare their performance.

## Requirements

1. Follow the provided link to download the notebook and/or data needed for this lab: [S1 - Lab Comparing Regular Neural Networks and CNNs on MNIST](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tUHs0U7Xfd7JSHyY3H6om7_YToJIqZJ4/view?usp=sharing)
2. Upload the notebook inside the lab to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

## Instructions

Follow the guided lesson in the notebook and complete the tasks.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Regular Sequential Neural Network

- Using MNIST Dataset, you need to build and train a regular sequential neural network.

### Task 2: Basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

- One the same dataset (MNIST), develop a second Neural Network but this time using a basic CNN.

### Task 3: Comparison
- After developing the previous models on MNIST Dataset, you need to compare the performance of both models
- Some questions to consider:
  1. Which model performed better? Why do you think this is the case?
  2. How do the learning curves differ between the two models?
  3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each approach?

## Submission

Once you finish the assignment, submit a URL link to your colab notebook in the field on Student Portal. (**Reminder**: The link to your notebook needs to be public.)

<!-- ## Tasks

### Task 1.

Using the confusion matrix calculate and explain metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
